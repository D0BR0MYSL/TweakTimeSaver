### How to download and deploy

- Please note that TwseakTimeSaver has not been tested at paths containing spaces, but should work. It's just better to not use spaces in folder names for command line scripts.

### How to use

- Run "start" script to reveal the Steps files. They are being renamed in according with native language used in system (if traslation file is present).
- Each command line batch script file is represented as a Step to apply group of settings at once.
- Step files have self-documented names for sequential launch.
- Any Step can be skiped.
- When starting, a short summary message is shown and nothing will apply until You press a key twice. Restore Point is being created automatically before actions.
- TweakTimeSaver has a seamlessly integrated mechanism for deployment of additional user settings and backups. It's optional, easy to use and being offered during use in very friendly way without distrubance.

Thanks for reading! TweakTimeSaver helped me a lot. I hope that it will be useful for You too!
